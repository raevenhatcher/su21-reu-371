## Abstract

Multiple sclerosis, also known as M.S., is a chronic central nervous system disease that potentially affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves in the eyes. In this potentially disabling disease, one's immune system attacks the myelin (protective sheath) that covers nerve fibers, resulting in communication problems between the brain and the body. The cause of M.S. is unknown; however, researchers believe that genetic and environmental factors play a role in those affected. Symptoms differ significantly from person to person due to varying nerves involved. The most common symptoms include tremors, numbness or weakness in limbs, vision loss, blurry vision, double vision, slurred speech, fatigue, dizziness, involuntary movement, and muscle paralysis. There is currently no cure for Multiple sclerosis. Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms.  
	There is no proven way to predict how an individual with Multiple Sclerosis will progress certainly. However, researchers established four phenotypes that will assist in identifying those who are more inclined to have disease progression and help aid in more effective treatment targeting.     
	In this experiment, Artificial Intelligence will be applied by ascertaining what causes these different phenotypes and which phenotype is at most risk for disease progression using a Magnetic Resonance Scan.

## 1. Introduction

MS or Multiple sclerosis is a potentially disabling autoimmune disease that can damage the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves located in the eyes. It is the most common progressive neurological disability that affects adolescents. The immune system attacks the central nervous system in this disease, specifically myelin (sheth that covers and protects nerve fibers), oligodendrocytes (myelin-producing cells), and the nerve fibers located under myelin. Myelin enables nerves to send and receive electrical signals swiftly and effectively. The myelin sheath becomes scarred from being attacked. These attacks make the myelin sheath inflamed in little patches, observable on an MRI scan. These little inflamed patches potentially disrupt messages moving along the nerves, which ultimately lead to the symptoms of Multiple sclerosis. If these attacks happen frequently, permanent damage can occur to the involved nerve.  
Because Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous symptoms, which control all of the actions carried out in the body, symptoms can affect any part of the body and vary. The most common symptoms of this progressive disease include muscle weakness, pins and needle sensation, electrical shock sensation, loss of bladder control, muscle spasms, tremors, double or blurred vision, partial or total vision loss, to name a few. Researchers are not sure what causes Multiple sclerosis but believe those between the ages of 20 and 40, are a woman, smoke, exposed to certain infections, have a vitamin D and B12 deficiency, and related to someone affected by this disease more susceptible.
It can be difficult to diagnose MS due to the symptoms usually being vague or very similar to other conditions. There is no single test to diagnose it positively. However, doctors can choose a neurological examination, MRI scan, evoked potential test, lumbar puncture, or a blood test to diagnose a patient properly.
 



## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

 steps to insert picture
 1. download picture to computer
 2. Upload image into repository
 3. Change path to what I saved picture as on github
 4. Create a description for the image 


   
## 4. Datasets

Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
the download function.
- [ ] look on google or kaggle to find dataset 
- [ ] http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=1017&show_dataset=E-GEOD-21942.  look on this website! find this first
- [ ] describe the dataset found
- [ ] mode, median, mean (can calculate this to add into section)

## 5. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
- [ ] define method that will be used to study the performance of the proposed method 
 
## 6. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 7. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.  can put instructors

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
